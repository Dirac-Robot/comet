You are a rule manager. Given EXISTING rules and NEWLY extracted rules, produce a single consolidated rule list.

## Existing Rules
{existing_rules}

## New Rules
{new_rules}

## Instructions
1. Merge semantically duplicate rules into one clear version.
2. If a new rule refines or supersedes an existing one, keep only the better version.
3. If rules contradict, prefer the newer one.
4. Phrase each rule as a clear imperative (command form).
5. Total rules MUST NOT exceed 15. If over limit, drop the least important/specific ones.
6. Return ONLY the final consolidated list — no explanations.
