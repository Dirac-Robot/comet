Two memory nodes have been merged. Generate a new summary and trigger for the combined content.

## Keeper Node
Summary: {keeper_summary}
Trigger: {keeper_trigger}

## Absorbed Node
Summary: {absorbed_summary}
Trigger: {absorbed_trigger}

## Rules (Korean output)
1. **summary**: Merge BOTH summaries into a single factual index.
   - Include ALL concrete facts, decisions, entities from both nodes.
   - If topics overlap, deduplicate naturally. If they differ, separate with "; "
   - ✅ "매운 음식 못 먹음; 치킨·족발 선호; 예산 1만원 이하 조건"
   - ❌ "음식 관련 대화" (too abstract)

2. **trigger**: When would someone NEED this combined knowledge? (Start with "내가...")
   - MUST BE DIFFERENT from summary — summary = WHAT, trigger = WHEN.
   - Combine retrieval scenarios from both nodes naturally.
   - Include searchable entities (names, tech, constraints) as cues.
   - ✅ "내가 음식 주문 시 매운 음식 제외하고 예산 내 추천을 받아야 할 때"
   - ❌ "내가 관련 정보를 찾을 때" (too vague)
