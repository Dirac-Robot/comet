Two memory nodes have been merged. Generate a new trigger for the combined content.

## Keeper Node
Summary: {keeper_summary}
Trigger: {keeper_trigger}

## Absorbed Node
Summary: {absorbed_summary}
Trigger: {absorbed_trigger}

Write a single trigger (Korean, "내가..." format) that covers BOTH nodes.
Include all specific entities, constraints, and data points from both triggers.
Do NOT write vague triggers like "내가 관련 정보를 찾을 때".
