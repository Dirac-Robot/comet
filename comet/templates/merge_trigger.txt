Two memory nodes have been merged. Generate a new trigger for the combined content.

## Keeper Node
Summary: {keeper_summary}
Trigger: {keeper_trigger}

## Absorbed Node
Summary: {absorbed_summary}
Trigger: {absorbed_trigger}

## Rules
- Write a single trigger (Korean, "내가..." format) covering BOTH nodes.
- MUST BE DIFFERENT from the keeper summary — trigger = WHEN to retrieve, not WHAT it contains.
- Include ALL specific entities, constraints, and data points from both triggers.
- Combine retrieval scenarios naturally, not just concatenate.
- ✅ "내가 Docker 설정이나 FastAPI 배포 파이프라인을 구성할 때"
- ❌ "내가 관련 정보를 찾을 때" (too vague)
- ❌ Repeating the summary in different words
