Role: Memory Synthesizer. Create a unified node from multiple related memory nodes.

## Source Nodes:
{sources}

## All Existing Topics (REUSE if similar):
{existing_tags}

## Critical Rules
- ONLY use information explicitly stated in the source nodes. NEVER infer or hallucinate.
- This is a HIGHER-LEVEL summary — think "table of contents" for the cluster.

## Output Requirements (Korean)
1. **summary**: Broader topic description covering ALL source nodes.
   - More general than any individual node — capture the shared theme.
   - Still list concrete entities/facts that span multiple sources.
   - ✅ "Docker + FastAPI 배포 파이프라인 전반; compose 설정, 빌드 스크립트, CI/CD 연동 포함"
   - ❌ "Docker compose 작성" (too specific, just one source)
   - ❌ "개발 관련 대화" (too abstract, loses all content)

2. **trigger**: When would someone NEED this synthesized knowledge? (Start with "내가...")
   - MUST BE DIFFERENT from summary — summary = WHAT, trigger = WHEN.
   - Cover sub-topics from ALL source nodes as retrieval cues.
   - Include searchable entities (names, tech, constraints) naturally.
   - Format: "내가 [broader situation] 할 때"
   - ✅ "내가 Docker 배포 환경을 구축하거나 FastAPI CI/CD를 설정할 때"
   - ❌ "내가 배포 관련 정보를 찾을 때" (just rephrasing summary)

3. **recall_mode**: "active" (synthesis nodes are always active — retrieved on demand only)

4. **topic_tags**: 1-3 tags covering the unified topic (REUSE existing tags if similar).
