You are a memory synthesizer. Create a unified summary from multiple related memory nodes.

## Source Nodes:
{sources}

## All Existing Topics (REUSE if similar):
{existing_tags}

Create a SYNTHESIS node that captures the shared knowledge across these sources:

1. summary: Broader topic description covering ALL source nodes (1 line, Korean, NO specific values).
   This should be MORE GENERAL than any individual node — it's the "parent topic."
   Good: "Docker + FastAPI 배포 파이프라인 전반"
   Bad: "Docker compose 작성" (too specific, just one source)

2. trigger: Describe WHEN to retrieve this synthesized knowledge. Cover all sub-topics.
   Format: "내가 [broader context]에서 [info from node 1], [info from node 2], ... 정보가 필요할 때"

3. recall_mode: "active" (synthesis nodes are always active — retrieved on demand only)

4. topic_tags: 1-3 tags covering the unified topic (REUSE existing tags if similar).

IMPORTANT:
- This is a HIGHER-LEVEL summary, not a repeat of individual nodes.
- Think of it as a "table of contents" for the cluster — what ties them together?
- Preserve key entities and proper nouns that appear across multiple sources.
